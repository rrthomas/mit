\subsection*{Typographical conventions}

Instructions and registers are shown in {\tt Typewriter} font;
interface calls are shown in {\bf Bold} type.

Addresses are given in bytes and refer to the VM address space except where
stated. Addresses are written in hexadecimal; hex numbers are prefixed with
“0x”.


\section{Introduction}

@PACKAGE_NAME@ is a simple virtual machine for study and experiment. It is a stack machine, based on the more complex register machine~\cite{mite0}.
This paper gives a full description of @PACKAGE_NAME@.

@PACKAGE_NAME@ is conceptually (and usually in fact) a library, embedded in other programs; it supports a simple object module format.


\section{Architecture}

@PACKAGE_NAME@'s address unit is the byte, which is eight bits.
Words are {\tt WORD\_BYTES} bytes. Most of the quantities on which @PACKAGE_NAME@ operates are words.
The size of the byte and range of word sizes allowed have been chosen with a view to making efficient implementation possible on the vast majority of current machine architectures.

Words have the bytes stored in big-endian or little-endian order, according to {\tt ENDISM}.


\subsection{Registers}
\label{registers}

The registers are word quantities; they are listed, with their functions, in table~\ref{regtable}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cp{3.75in}} \toprule
\bf Register & \bf Function \\
 \midrule
{\tt PC} & The {\tt P}rogram {\tt C}ounter. Points to the next word from which {\tt I} may be loaded. \\
{\tt I} & The {\tt I}nstruction register. Contains instructions to be executed. \\
{\tt BAD} & The invalid stack position, or invalid or unaligned memory address, that last caused an error. \\
{\tt STACK\_DEPTH} & The number of items on the stack. \\
{\tt ENDISM} & The endianness of @PACKAGE_NAME@: 0 = Little-endian, 1 = Big-endian. \\
{\tt WORD\_BYTES} & The number of bytes in a word. Must be in the range $2$ to $32$ inclusive, and a power of $2$. \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{regtable}Registers}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\subsection{Memory}

@PACKAGE_NAME@'s memory is a contiguous sequence of bytes with addresses
starting at $0$. The address of a word is that of the byte in it with the
lowest address.


\subsection{Stack}

The stack is a LIFO stack of words used for passing values to instructions and routines and for holding subroutine return addresses. To {\bf push} an item on to
the stack means to add a new item to the top of the stack, increasing the stack depth by $1$; to {\bf pop} an item means to reduce the stack depth by $1$. Instructions that change the number of items on the stack implicitly pop their arguments and push their results.


\subsection{Operation}
\label{operation}

Before @PACKAGE_NAME@ is started, {\tt ENDISM} should be set to $0$ or $1$ according to the implementation, and {\tt WORD\_BYTES} to the appropriate value. The other registers should be initialised to~$0$.

{\tt ENDISM} and {\tt WORD\_BYTES} must not change.

Execution proceeds as follows:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.5in}\=begin\=\+\+ \\*
execute the instruction in the \instsize\ least-significant bits of {\tt I} \\*
shift {\tt I} logically \instsize\ bits to the right \- \\*
repeat
\end{tabbing}

In the latter case, the contents of the execution cycle is executed once, and
control returns to the calling program.


\subsection{Errors and termination}
\label{errors}

When @PACKAGE_NAME@ encounters certain abnormal situations, such as an attempt to access an invalid address, or divide by zero, an {\bf error} is {\bf raised}, and execution terminates; an {\bf error code} is returned to the caller. The instruction has no effect, and {\tt PC} is not advanced to the next instruction. If the error is a stack or memory access error, {\tt BAD} is set to the stack position or address that caused the error.

Execution can also be terminated explicitly by performing a {\tt HALT} instruction (see section~\ref{haltact}).

Error codes are unsigned numbers. $0$ to $128$ are reserved for @PACKAGE_NAME@'s own error codes; the meanings of those that may be raised by @PACKAGE_NAME@ are shown in table~\ref{errortable}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cp{4in}} \toprule
\bf Code & \bf Meaning \\ \midrule
$0$ & {\bf single\_step()} has terminated without error. \\
$1$ & Invalid opcode (see section~\ref{opcodes}). \\
$2$ & Stack overflow. {\tt BAD} is set to the extra number of words of stack space required. \\
$3$ & Invalid stack read. {\tt BAD} is set to the invalid stack position. \\
$4$ & Invalid stack write. {\tt BAD} is set to the invalid stack position. \\
$5$ & Invalid memory read. {\tt BAD} is set to the invalid address. \\
$6$ & Invalid memory write. {\tt BAD} is set to the invalid address. \\
$7$ & Address alignment error: raised when an instruction is given a valid address, but insufficiently aligned. \\
$8$ & Invalid size (greater than $log_2{\tt WORD\_BYTES}$). \\
$9$ & Division by zero attempted (see section~\ref{arithmetic}). \\
$128$ & A {\tt HALT} instruction was executed. \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{errortable}Errors raised by @PACKAGE_NAME@}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{Instruction set}
\label{instset}

The instruction set is listed below,
with the instructions grouped according to function. The
instructions are given in the following format:

\begin{description}
\inst{NAME}{before — after}{Description.}
\end{description}

The first line consists of the name of the instruction. On the right is the
stack effect, which shows the effect of the instruction on the stack.
Underneath is the description.

{\bf Stack effects} are written

\centerline{\tt ( \spic{before — after} )}

\noindent where \spic{before} and \spic{after} are stack pictures showing the items on top
of a stack before and after the instruction is executed.
An instruction only affects the items shown in its
stack effects. The brackets and dashes serve merely to delimit the stack
effect and to separate \spic{before} from \spic{after}. {\bf Stack pictures}
are a representation of the top-most items on the stack, and are written

\centerline{\spic{i$_1$ i$_2$\dots i$_{n-1}$ i$_n$}}

\noindent where the \spic{i$_k$} are stack items, each of which occupies a whole number of
words, with \spic{i$_n$} being on top of the stack. The symbols denoting
different types of stack item are shown in table~\ref{typetable}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl} \toprule
\bf Symbol & \bf Data type \\ \midrule
\spic{flag} & a Boolean flag, $1$ for true and $0$ for false \\
\spic{size} & an integer in the range $0$ to $log_2{\tt WORD\_BYTES}$ inclusive. \\
\spic{n} & signed number \\
\spic{u} & unsigned number \\
\spic{n{\tt |}u} & number (signed or unsigned) \\
\spic{x} & unspecified word \\
\spic{addr} & address \\
\spic{a-addr} & word-aligned address \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{typetable}Types used in stack effects}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Types are only used to indicate how instructions treat their arguments and
results; @PACKAGE_NAME@ does not distinguish between stack items of different types. In
stack pictures the most general argument types with which each instruction can
be supplied are given; subtypes may be substituted. Using the phrase ``$i
\Rightarrow j$'' to denote ``$i$\/ is a subtype of $j$\/'', table~\ref{reltable}
shows the subtype relationships. The subtype relation is transitive.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{c} \toprule
\spic{u} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{x} \\
\spic{n} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{x} \\
\spic{flag} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{u} \\
\spic{size} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{u} \\
\spic{a-addr} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{addr} $\Rightarrow$ \spic{u} \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{reltable}The subtype relation}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Numbers are represented in twos complement form. \spic{addr} consists of all
valid virtual machine addresses. Numeric constants can be included in
stack pictures, and are of type \spic{n{\tt |}u}.

Each type may be suffixed by a number in stack pictures; if the same combination
of type and suffix appears more than once in a stack effect, it refers to
identical stack items. Alternative \spic{after} pictures are separated by ``{\tt
|}'', and the circumstances under which each occurs are detailed in the
instruction description.

Ellipsis is used for indeterminate numbers of specified types of word.


\subsection{Instruction fetch}

\begin{description}
\inst{NEXT}{—}{If {\tt I} is not $0$, raise error $1$. Load the word pointed to by {\tt PC} into {\tt I} then add {\tt WORD\_BYTES} to {\tt PC}. If {\tt PC} is not word-aligned, raise error $7$, setting {\tt BAD} to the contents of {\tt PC}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Control}
\label{control}

These instructions implement unconditional and conditional branches, and subroutine
call and return (subroutine return is {\tt BRANCH}):

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{BRANCH}{a-addr —}{Set {\tt PC} to \spic{a-addr}. Perform the action of {\tt NEXT}.}
\inst{BRANCHZ}{flag a-addr —}{If \spic{flag} is false then set {\tt PC} to \spic{a-addr} and perform the action of {\tt NEXT}.}
\inst{CALL}{\aaddr1 — \aaddr2}{Exchange {\tt PC} with the top stack value. Perform the action of {\tt NEXT}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Stack manipulation}

These instructions manage the stack:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{POP}{x —}{Remove \spic{x} from the stack.}
\inst{DUP}{\x{u}\dots\x0 u — \x{u}\dots\x0 \x{u}}{Remove \spic{u}. Copy \x{u} to the top of the stack.}
\inst{SWAP}{\x{u+1}\dots\x0 u — \x0 \x{u}\dots\x1 \x{u+1}}{Exchange the top stack item with the \spic{u+1}th.}
\inst{GET\_STACK\_DEPTH}{— u}{\spic{u} is the value of {\tt STACK\_DEPTH}, the number of items on the stack.}
\inst{SET\_STACK\_DEPTH}{u —}{Set {\tt STACK\_DEPTH} to \spic{u}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Literals}

\begin{description}
\inst{LIT}{— n}{The word pointed to by {\tt PC} is pushed on to the stack, and {\tt PC} is incremented to point to the following word.}
\inst{LIT\_PC\_REL}{— n}{Like {\tt LIT}, except that the initial value of {\tt PC} is added to the value pushed on to the stack.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Logic and shifts}

Logic functions:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{NOT}{\x1 — \x2}{Invert all bits of \x1, giving its logical inverse \x2.}
\inst{AND}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit logical ``and'' of \x1 with \x2.}
\inst{OR}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit inclusive-or of \x1 with \x2.}
\inst{XOR}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit exclusive-or of \x1 with \x2.}
\end{description}

Shifts:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{LSHIFT}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform a logical left shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Put zero into the least significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, \x2 is zero.}
\inst{RSHIFT}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform a logical right shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Put zero into the most significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, \x2 is zero.}
\inst{ARSHIFT}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform an arithmetic right shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Copy the original most-significant bits into the most significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, all the bits of \x2 are the same as the original most-significant bit.}
\inst{SIGN\_EXTEND}{u size — n}{Sign extend the $2^{\spic{size}}$-byte quantity \spic{u} to \spic{n}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Comparison}

These words compare two numbers (or, for equality tests, any two words) on the
stack, returning a flag:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{EQ}{\x1 \x2 — flag}{\spic{flag} is true if and only if \x1 is bit-for-bit the same as \x2.}
\inst{LT}{\n1 \n2 — flag}{\spic{flag} is true if and only if \n1 is less than \n2.}
\inst{ULT}{\U1 \U2 — flag}{\spic{flag} is true if and only if \U1 is less than \U2.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Arithmetic}
\label{arithmetic}

These instructions consist of monadic and dyadic operators.
All calculations are made without bounds or overflow checking, except
as detailed for certain instructions.

Negation and addition:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{NEGATE}{\n1 — \n2}{Negate \n1, giving its arithmetic inverse \n2.}
\inst{ADD}{\noru1 \noru2 — \noru3}{Add \noru2 to \noru1, giving the sum \noru3.}
\end{description}

Multiplication and division (note that all division instructions raise error
$-4$ if division by zero is attempted):

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{MUL}{\noru1 \noru2 — \noru3}{Multiply \noru1 by \noru2 giving the product \noru3.}
\inst{DIVMOD}{\n1 \n2 — \n3 \n4}{Divide \n1 by \n2 using symmetric division, giving the single-word quotient \n3 and the single-word remainder \n4. The quotient is rounded towards zero.}
\inst{UDIVMOD}{\U1 \U2 — \U3 \U4}{Divide \U1 by \U2, giving the single-word quotient \U3 and the single-word remainder \U4.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Memory}

These instructions fetch and store quantities to and from memory.
If a given address is incorrectly aligned, raise error $7$, setting {\tt BAD} to the address.

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{LOAD}{addr size — x}{Load the $2^{\spic{size}}$-byte quantity \spic{x} stored at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of \spic{size}. Any unused high-order bits are set to zero.}
\inst{STORE}{x addr size —}{Store the $2^{\spic{size}}$ least-significant bytes of \spic{x} at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of \spic{size}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{External access}

This instruction is a general-purpose escape. In contrast to extra instructions, which are intended to be frequently used and potentially optimized, {\tt EXT}’s behaviour is not defined; in particular, it has an arbitrary stack effect.

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{EXT}{}{Perform arbitrary actions.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Termination}
\label{haltact}

This instruction terminates execution (see section~\ref{errors}):

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{HALT}{—}{Terminate execution with error code $128$.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Instruction encoding}
\label{encoding}

Instructions are encoded as {\instsize}-bit opcodes; opcodes are packed into words, which are executed starting at the least-significant bits.


\subsection{Instruction opcodes}
\label{opcodes}

Table~\ref{opcodetable} lists the instruction opcodes in numerical order. Other instruction opcodes are undefined.

\begin{table}[htb]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{*{2}{cc}} \toprule
\bf Opcode & \bf Instruction & \bf Opcode & \bf Instruction \\ \midrule
\opcodetbl{00}{NEXT}		{10}{EQ}

 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}

\end{table}


\section{External interface}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementations should provide an \textbf{API} to create and run virtual machine instances, and provide access to its registers, stack and memory.
\item Implementations can add \textbf{extra instructions} to provide extra computational primitives.
\item The {\tt EXT} instruction can offer access to system facilities, previously written code, native libraries and so on.
\item The \textbf{object module} format allows compiled code to be saved, reloaded and shared between systems.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Object module format}
\label{object}

The object module starts with the ASCII codes of the letters
``@PACKAGE@'' followed by ASCII NUL (0x00), then the one-byte values of
the {\tt ENDISM} and {\tt WORD\_BYTES} registers of the system which saved the module, then a word (of the given endianness and size) containing the number of bytes the code occupies. Then follows the code.

Object modules have a simple structure, as they are only intended for loading an
initial memory image into @PACKAGE_NAME@.


\section*{Acknowledgements}

Martin Richards's demonstration of his BCPL-oriented Cintcode virtual machine~\cite{cintweb}
convinced me it was going to be fun working on virtual machines. He also supervised my BA dissertation project, Beetle~\cite{beetledis}, on which @PACKAGE_NAME@ is based.
