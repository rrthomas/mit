\title{The Mit virtual machine}
\author{Reuben Thomas}
\date{10th May 2020}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\subsection*{Typographical conventions}

Instructions and registers are shown in {\tt typewriter} font.

Addresses are given in bytes. Addresses are written in hexadecimal; hex numbers are prefixed with “0x”.


\section{Introduction}

Mit is a simple virtual machine. It is a stack machine, based on the more complex register machine Mite~\cite{mite0}.
This paper gives a full description of Mit.

Mit is conceptually (and usually in fact) a library, embedded in other programs.


\section{Architecture}

The address unit is the byte, which is eight bits.
Most of the quantities on which Mit operates are fixed-size words, which are stored in memory in either big- or little-endian order. The number of bytes in a word is called {\tt word\_bytes}, and must be $4$ or $8$.

The choice of byte and word size enable efficient implementation on the vast majority of machine architectures.


\subsection{Registers}
\label{registers}

The registers are word quantities; they are listed, with their functions, in table~\ref{regtable}. The registers are initialised to~$0$.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cp{3.75in}} \toprule
\bf Register & \bf Function \\
 \midrule
{\tt pc} & The {\tt p}rogram {\tt c}ounter. Points to the next word from which {\tt i} may be loaded. \\
{\tt ir} & The {\tt i}nstruction {\tt r}egister. Contains instructions to be executed. \\
{\tt stack\_depth} & The number of words in the current stack frame. \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{regtable}Registers}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\subsection{Memory}

Mit's memory consists of discontiguous words in a flat address space. The address of a word is that of the byte in it with the lowest address.


\subsection{Stack}

The stack is a last-in-first-out stack of call frames. Each frame is a stack of words. The phrase “the stack” usually refers to the current frame, and all references to stack items refer to the current frame. To {\bf push} a word on to the stack means to add a new word to the top of the stack, increasing the stack depth by $1$; to {\bf pop} a word means to reduce the stack depth by $1$. Instructions that change the number of words on the stack implicitly pop their arguments and push their results.


\subsection{Execution}
\label{execution}

Execution proceeds as follows:

\begin{tabbing}
\hspace{0.2in}\=rep\=eat\+\+ \\*
let \textbf{opcode} be the least significant byte of {\tt ir} \\*
shift {\tt ir} arithmetically one byte to the right \\*
execute the instruction given by \textbf{opcode}, \\*
\hspace{1em}or throw error $-1$ if the opcode is invalid \-
\end{tabbing}

\noindent If an error occurs during execution (see section~\ref{errors}),
stack frames are popped until reaching one which contains an error handler.
The error handler, return address and number of return items are discarded,
and the error code is pushed on to the stack.

\subsection{Errors and termination}
\label{errors}

When Mit encounters certain abnormal situations, such as an attempt to access an invalid address, or divide by zero, an {\bf error} is {\bf thrown}. If the error is non-zero, the effect of the current instruction is undone (see section~\ref{execution}). An {\bf error code} is returned to the caller.

Execution can be terminated explicitly by a {\tt throw} instruction (see section~\ref{extra}), which throws an error.

Error codes are signed numbers. $0$ to $-127$ are reserved for the specification; other error codes may be used by implementations. The meanings of those that may be thrown by Mit are shown in table~\ref{errortable}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cp{4in}} \toprule
\bf Code & \bf Meaning \\ \midrule
$0$ & Execution has terminated without error. \\
$-1$ & Invalid opcode (see section~\ref{opcodes}). \\
$-2$ & Stack overflow. \\
$-3$ & Invalid stack read. \\
$-4$ & Invalid stack write. \\
$-5$ & Invalid memory read. \\
$-6$ & Invalid memory write. \\
$-7$ & Address alignment error: thrown when an instruction is given a valid address, but insufficiently aligned. \\
$-8$ & Division by zero attempted (see section~\ref{arithmetic}). \\
$-127$ & An instruction has completed without error. \\
 \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{errortable}Errors thrown by Mit}
\end{center}
\end{table}


\section{Instruction set}
\label{instset}

The instruction set is listed below,
with the instructions grouped according to function. The
instructions are given in the following format:

\begin{description}
\inst{NAME}{before — after}{Description.}
\end{description}

The first line consists of the name of the instruction. On the right is the
stack effect, which shows the effect of the instruction on the stack.
Underneath is the description.

{\bf Stack effects} are written

\centerline{\tt ( \spic{before — after} )}

\noindent where \spic{before} and \spic{after} are stack pictures showing the items on top
of a stack before and after the instruction is executed.
An instruction only affects the items shown in its
stack effects. The brackets and dashes serve merely to delimit the stack
effect and to separate \spic{before} from \spic{after}.
An stack item \spic{[x]} in square brackets is optional.

{\bf Stack pictures}
are a representation of the top-most items on the stack, and are written

\centerline{\spic{i$_1$ i$_2$\dots i$_{n-1}$ i$_n$}}

\noindent where the \spic{i$_k$} are stack items, each of which occupies a word, with \spic{i$_n$} being on top of the stack. The symbols denoting different types of stack item are shown in table~\ref{typetable}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{cl} \toprule
\bf Symbol & \bf Data type \\ \midrule
\spic{flag} & a Boolean flag, $0$ for false or non-zero for true \\
\spic{s} & signed number \\
\spic{u} & unsigned number \\
\spic{n} & number (signed or unsigned) \\
\spic{x} & unspecified word \\
\spic{addr} & address \\
\spic{a-addr} & word-aligned address \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{\label{typetable}Types used in stack effects}
\end{center}
\end{table}

Numbers are represented in two's complement form. \spic{addr} consists of all
valid virtual machine addresses.

Each type may be suffixed by a number in stack pictures; if the same combination
of type and suffix appears more than once in a stack effect, it refers each time to the identical stack item.

Ellipsis is used for indeterminate numbers of specified types of item.


\subsection{Extra instructions}
\label{extra}

Extra instructions are introduced by the instruction {\tt extra}:

\begin{description}
\inst{extra}{{\rm see below}}{Perform extra instruction {\tt ir}; if {\tt ir} is not the code of a valid extra instruction, throw error $-1$.}
\end{description}

The following extra instructions are defined:

\begin{description}
\extra{next}{0}{—}{Load the word pointed to by {\tt pc} into {\tt ir}, then add {\tt word\_bytes} to {\tt pc}. If an invalid or unaligned address is accessed when loading {\tt ir}, the appropriate error is thrown (see section~\ref{errors}).}
\extra{throw}{1}{n —}{Throw error $n$.}
\extra{catch}{2}{\x{u}\dots\x0 \U1 \U2 [\aaddr1] — h \U2 \aaddr2 {\tt ||} \x{u}\dots\x0}{Add an error handler \spic{h} to the current stack frame, then perform the action of {\tt call} (see section~\ref{control}).}
\end{description}


\subsection{Trap}
\label{trap}

An implementation may implement extra functionality using {\tt trap}:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{trap}{}{Perform trap {\tt ir}; if {\tt ir} is not the code of a valid trap, throw error $-1$.}
\end{description}

The following trap is defined:

\begin{description}
\extra{nextff}{$-1$}{—}{Perform the action of {\tt next}.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Stack manipulation}

These instructions manage the stack:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{pop}{x —}{Remove \spic{x} from the stack.}
\inst{dup}{\x{u}\dots\x0 u — \x{u}\dots\x0 \x{u}}{Remove \spic{u}. Copy \x{u} to the top of the stack.}
\inst{swap}{\x{u+1}\dots\x0 u — \x0 \x{u}\dots\x1 \x{u+1}}{Exchange the top stack word with the \spic{u+1}th.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Control}
\label{control}

These instructions implement unconditional and conditional branches, and subroutine call and return.

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{jump}{[a-addr] —}{If {\tt ir} is $0$, set {\tt pc} to \spic{a-addr}; otherwise, add $\texttt{ir}\times\texttt{word\_bytes}$ to {\tt pc}, and set {\tt ir} to $0$.}
\inst{jumpz}{flag [a-addr] —}{If \spic{flag} is false then perform the action of {\tt jump}; otherwise, set {\tt ir} to $0$.}
\inst{call}{\x{u}\dots\x0 \U1 \U2 [\aaddr1] — \U2 \aaddr2 {\tt ||} \x{u}\dots\x0}{Perform the action of {\tt jump}. Move \spic{\x{\U1}\dots\x0} to a new call frame. Push the initial value of {\tt pc} to the old frame.}
\inst{ret}{[h] \U2 a-addr {\tt ||} \x{\U2}\dots\x0 — \x{u}\dots\x0 [$0$]}{Pop the current stack frame, set {\tt pc} to \spic{a-addr}, and move \spic{\x{\U2}\dots\x0} to it. Set {\tt ir} to $0$. If there is an error handler \spic{h} in the inner stack frame, discard it and push $0$ on top of the stack.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Memory}

These instructions fetch and store quantities to and from memory. If an invalid or unaligned address is accessed, the appropriate error is thrown (see section~\ref{errors}).

\begin{description}
\inst{load}{addr — x}{Load the word \spic{x} stored at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of {\tt word\_bytes}.}
\inst{store}{x addr —}{Store \spic{x} at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of {\tt word\_bytes}.}
\inst{load1}{addr — x}{Load the byte \spic{x} stored at \spic{addr}. Unused high-order bits are set to zero.}
\inst{store1}{x addr —}{Store the least-significant byte of \spic{x} at \spic{addr}.}
\inst{load2}{addr — x}{Load the $2$-byte quantity \spic{x} stored at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of $2$. Unused high-order bits are set to zero.}
\inst{store2}{x addr —}{Store the $2$ least-significant bytes of \spic{x} at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of $2$.}
\inst{load4}{addr — x}{Load the $4$-byte quantity \spic{x} stored at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of $4$. Any unused high-order bits are set to zero.}
\inst{store4}{x addr —}{Store the $4$ least-significant bytes of \spic{x} at \spic{addr}, which must be a multiple of $4$.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Constants}

\begin{description}
\inst{push}{— n}{The word pointed to by {\tt pc} is pushed on to the stack, and {\tt pc} is incremented to point to the following word.}
\inst{pushrel}{— n}{Like {\tt push}, except that the initial value of {\tt pc} is added to the value pushed on to the stack.}
\end{description}

There are also variants {\tt pushi} and {\tt pushreli}, which encode a limited range of constants in the instruction opcode; see section~\ref{opcodes}.


\subsection{Logic}
\label{logic}

Logic functions:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{not}{\x1 — \x2}{Invert all bits of \x1, giving its logical inverse \x2.}
\inst{and}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit logical “and” of \x1 with \x2.}
\inst{or}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit inclusive-or of \x1 with \x2.}
\inst{xor}{\x1 \x2 — \x3}{\x3 is the bit-by-bit exclusive-or of \x1 with \x2.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Comparison}

These words compare two numbers on the stack, returning a flag (for equality, use {\tt xor}; see section~\ref{logic}):

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{lt}{\n1 \n2 — flag}{\spic{flag} is $1$ if and only if \n1 is less than \n2.}
\inst{ult}{\U1 \U2 — flag}{\spic{flag} is $1$ if and only if \U1 is less than \U2.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Shifts}

\begin{description}
\inst{lshift}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform a logical left shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Put zero into the least significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, \x2 is zero.}
\inst{rshift}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform a logical right shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Put zero into the most significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, \x2 is zero.}
\inst{arshift}{\x1 u — \x2}{Perform an arithmetic right shift of \spic{u} bit-places on \x1, giving \x2. Copy the original most-significant bits into the most significant bits vacated by the shift. If \spic{u} is greater than or equal to the number of bits in a word, all the bits of \x2 are the same as the original most-significant bit.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Arithmetic}
\label{arithmetic}

These instructions consist of monadic and dyadic operators.
All calculations are made without bounds or overflow checking, except
as detailed for certain instructions.

Negation and addition:

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{negate}{\n1 — \n2}{Negate \n1, giving \n2.}
\inst{add}{\noru1 \noru2 — \noru3}{Add \noru2 to \noru1, giving the sum \noru3.}
\end{description}

Multiplication and division (note that division instructions throw error
$-8$ if division by zero is attempted):

\nopagebreak
\begin{description}
\inst{mul}{\noru1 \noru2 — \noru3}{Multiply \noru1 by \noru2 giving the product \noru3.}
\inst{divmod}{\n1 \n2 — \n3 \n4}{Divide \n1 by \n2 using symmetric division, giving the single-word quotient \n3 and the single-word remainder \n4. The quotient is rounded towards zero.}
\inst{udivmod}{\U1 \U2 — \U3 \U4}{Divide \U1 by \U2, giving the single-word quotient \U3 and the single-word remainder \U4.}
\end{description}


\subsection{Instruction encoding}
\label{encoding}

Instructions are encoded as byte opcodes; opcodes are packed into words, which are executed starting at the least-significant bits. The opcodes have the following structure:

\begin{center}
  \begin{bytefield}[endianness=big,bitwidth=2em]{8}
    \bitheader{0-7}\\
    \bitbox{6}{instruction}\bitboxes*{1}{00}\\[1ex]
    \bitbox{6}{{\tt pushi} operand}\bitboxes*{1}{10}\\[1ex]
    \bitbox{7}{{\tt pushreli} operand}\bitbox{1}{1}\\
    except\\[0.5ex]
    \bitbox{8}{11111111 = {\tt trap}}
  \end{bytefield}
\end{center}

The operands for {\tt pushi} and {\tt pushreli} are interpreted as signed numbers; the operand of {\tt pushreli} is multiplied by {\tt word\_bytes}. Note that {\tt pushreli}’s immediate constant cannot be $-1$, as the corresponding opcode is used for {\tt trap}.

\subsection{Instruction opcodes}
\label{opcodes}

Table~\ref{opcodetable} lists the instruction opcodes. Other instruction opcodes are invalid.

% FIXME: use “Tabular hex numerals”

\section{External interface}

\begin{itemize}
\item Implementations should provide an API to create and run virtual machine code, and to add traps.
\item Implementations can add extra instructions (see section~\ref{extra}) to provide extra computational primitives and other deeply-integrated facilities.
\item Implementations can allow users to add traps (see section~\ref{trap}) to offer access to system facilities, native libraries and so on.
\end{itemize}
