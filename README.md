# SMite

SMite is a simple virtual machine designed for study and experiment. It uses
a byte-stream code designed for efficient execution which is binary portable
between implementations. It has been implemented in C for POSIX systems.
SMite is designed to be embedded in other programs; Python 3 bindings are
provided that demonstrate this ability and provide a convenient REPL and
debugger. In the C implementation, all memory references are bounds checked.
An I/O library is implemented; access to native code routines is also
possible, allowing SMite and C programs to call each other.

This package comprises the definition of the SMite virtual machine and an
implementation in ISO C99 using POSIX APIs. Detailed documentation is in the
`doc` directory; installation instructions follow. Maintainers should read
`HACKING.md`.

The package is distributed under the MIT/X11 License (see the file `COPYING`). Note that some files are in the public domain, notably the specification of SMite; they are marked as such.

THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS, WITH NO WARRANTY. USE IS AT THE USER’S
RISK.


## Compatibility

SMite should work on any POSIX-1.2001-compatible system. SMite has been
tested on x86_64 GNU/Linux with GNU C.

Reports on compatibility, whether positive or negative, are welcomed.


### Building from a release tarball

Perl and help2man are required to build from source. For building from git,
see below.

To build SMite from a release tarball, run

`./configure && make && make check`

For the bibliographies in the documentation to be built correctly, GNU Make
should be used.


### Building SMite from git

The GNU autotools are required: automake, autoconf and libtool.
[Gnulib](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/) is also used, with a
third-party `bootstrap` module; these are installed automatically.

To build from a Git repository, first run `./bootstrap`, then see "Building
from source" above.

To build the PDF documentation, a comprehensive TeX system such as TeXLive
is required. This is only necessary when building from Git, as pre-built
PDFs are supplied in release archives. 


## Use

Run `smite OBJECT-FILE` (see `smite --help` for documentation). To run the
shell, `python3 -i -m smite`.


## C API

Include `smite/smite.h` (see this file for its documentation), and link with
`libsmite`. In addition, `smite/opcodes.h` contains an enumeration type of
SMite’s instruction set.


## Documentation

The documentation consists of:

* _[The SMite Virtual Machine](doc/smite.pdf)_  
The design of the SMite virtual machine is described. Essential reading
for those programming or implementing the VM.
* The comments in `smite.h`.
* Comments in the Python modules.

SMite is based on [Beetle](https://github.com/rrthomas/beetle), which I
developed for my BA dissertation project.


## pForth

[pForth](https://github.com/rrthomas/pforth) is an ANSI Forth compiler that
targets SMite.


## Running SMite object files

The C implementation of SMite allows a hash-bang line to be prepended to an object file, so that they can be run directly. A suggested line is:

```
#!/usr/bin/env smite
```

A magic file for the file(1) command is also provided: smite.magic.


## Bugs and comments

Please send bug reports (preferably as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/rrthomas/smite/issues))
and comments. I’m especially interested to know of portability bugs.
