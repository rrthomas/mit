    Specialized VM instruction descriptor.
    
     - guard - str - C expression which must evaluate to true for the
       specialized instruction to be executed. The guard may assume that the
       stack contains enough items to read `effect.args`.
     
    Specialized instructions have only one control flow path. Instructions with
    more than one control flow path are modelled as several specialized
    instructions with the same opcode and different guard expressions; the
    guards for a particular opcode must be exclusive.

    Specialized instructions cannot be variadic.
